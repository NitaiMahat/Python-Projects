'''
Alien Invasion Game

In this game, the player controls a spaceship to defeat waves of monsters,
earning points as they go. Each wave increases the speed of the monsters and changes it.
After a certain score, the game transitions to a boss fight, where the
spaceship is transported to a different dimension.
The boss moves diagonally and turns invisible at intervals.
The goal is to defeat the boss to win.

Includes:
- Story introduction before gameplay.
- Monster changes and the speed increase between waves.
- Final boss fight with unique movement and invisibility.
- Health point of the final boss is deducted upon collision and not deducted when invisibile
- Replay features where the starting story mode is skipped.
- Winning window with moving text which is dispalyed after player has won the game.
